   - Managing other users and updating order status

## Live site

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- SCSS
- React JS
- Redux
- MongoDB, Mongoose
- Nodejs, Express

## My process
One of my biggest time sinks while working on a project is design. So for this project I worked a good deal with Figma getting the look I wanted so when i dived into styling I had some references! I plan to add a link to Figma doc when I've cleaned it up a bit for presentation, since it was my first real work with the technology.

I started out with the client and the parts of the site unrelated to accounts. The shop, the home page and the cart. I got these set up with the backend using a sample data file and then moved onto the user experience. I really like how Stripe looks and works, so I set that up. I used Paypal in a course before, so I had a general idea of how payment sandboxes worked.

Once I got the basics down, I implemented a local cart for a user that wasn't logged in addition to the stored cart. I also added the admin functionality of managing users, products and orders.


## What I learned
- I got more practice designing and setting up a SCSS boilerplate. I really enjoy nesting, using mixins for reusability and organizing the stying in separate files. My next goal for styling would be to implement SCSS with Tailwind and see how I like the combination.

- General familiarity with creating a fullstack application using React and Nodejs. I was a lot quicker this time around and was able to solve problems I came across working on my Personal Blog with more ease. Deployment was a lot better with more experience.
