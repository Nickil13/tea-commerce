# Tea-commerce
E-commerce website for tea built with a React frontend and a Node.js backend.

- Register as a new user
- Inspect products and add them to your cart
- Place orders, pay using the Stripe sandbox
- Look at your user information, wishlist and orders

As an admin: 
   - API CRUD operations for adding, editing and removing products
   - Managing other users and updating order status

## Live site
- Site deployed with Heroku at: https://tea-commerce-app.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- SCSS
- React
- Redux
- MongoDB, Mongoose
- Node.js, Express

## My process
I noticed that I spend a good amount of time on a project working on its design. For this project I decided to use Figma so I would have some references for when I dove into styling.

I started out with the frontend and the parts of the site unrelated to accounts. The shop, the home page and the cart. I got these set up with the backend using a sample data file and then moved onto the user experience. I really like how Stripe looks and works, so I set that up. I used Paypal in a course before, so I had a general idea of how payment sandboxes worked.

Once I got the base down, I implemented a local cart for a user that wasn't logged in addition to the stored cart. I also added the admin functionality of managing users, products and orders.


## What I learned
- I got more practice designing and setting up a SCSS boilerplate. I really enjoy nesting, using mixins for reusability and organizing the stying in separate files. My next goal for styling would be to implement SCSS with Tailwind and see how I like the combination.

- General familiarity with creating a fullstack application using React and Nodejs. I was a lot quicker this time around and was able to solve problems I came across working on my Personal Blog with more ease. Deployment was a lot better with more experience.
